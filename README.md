# Vehicle-Document-Management

This project proposes a Decentralized Application where drivers can upload and access their vehicle documents details 
using OCR anywhere, anytime digitally. A Quick Response Code (QR- Code) is used to store URL generated by the vehicle
owner by uploading the vehicle documents, which can be later scanned by the Traffic Officer for verification purpose.
The application notifies the vehicle owner on expiration of any documents that must be renewed. The application helps 
in reducing the overhead efforts made by the Traffic officers for vehicle verification. The objective of the system is
to digitize all documents, ensure authenticity of documents, eliminate the use of fake documents, manage vehicle documents,
reduce the workload and time.
